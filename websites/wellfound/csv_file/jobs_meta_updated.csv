Konko AI is building the agent-native EHR for Latin America. Our AI agents take work off the clinic’s plate—automating intake, transcription, data capture, scheduling, and follow-ups—while turning unstructured workflows into structured, auditable clinical data. Clinics see 20–50% growth, staff reclaim 3–4 hours per day, and patients get a faster, clearer experience. We’re an experienced, high-bar team (Tesla, C3 AI, BCG, Harvard, UCLA, Georgia Tech) operating inside real clinics today and scaling quickly across LATAM—building a category-defining company.

The Role

Shape a running agent platform into a clinician-grade product and an agent-native EHR. Extend configurable per-clinic workflows, connect them to a FHIR data spine, and help ship focused React/TypeScript surfaces where they unlock daily operations. Your work automates transcription and data entry, streamlines patient operations, and replaces legacy EHR modules over time. Senior IC on a CET-centric team with a high bar for performance and craft.

What You’ll Do
Expand configurable clinic workflows so agents automate real work: intake, transcription, data capture, scheduling, and follow-ups.
Implement a practical FHIR interop layer (via Medplum) for core resources—Patient, Appointment, Encounter, Practitioner, Location, Consent, DocumentReference.
Build migration and integration tooling to bring data from legacy EHRs/schedulers into our model/FHIR with validation, dry-runs, and safe rollbacks.
Deliver thin, fast operator/EHR surfaces in React/TypeScript (patient registry, timeline, appointments board, consent tracker) that clinicians actually use.
Raise observability and reliability across the platform with clear SLOs, tracing, actionable logs, and privacy/audit boundaries by tenant.
Improve developer ergonomics: local dev harnesses, golden datasets, CI gates that prevent regressions, and lightweight docs that speed onboarding.
Partner with Solutions Engineering to translate real clinic workflows into reusable building blocks; set a high bar in design and code reviews.
You Are
A senior IC who owns outcomes end-to-end and ships production quality.
A systems-plus-product thinker: you model workflows, design clear APIs/data models, and keep things simple.
Fast, pragmatic, and 80/20 by default—small slices, quick iterations, measurable impact.
High bar for performance and craft: testing discipline, thoughtful abstractions, solid DX.
Backend-first: able to contribute to front-end when it unlocks value.
Security-minded and careful with patient data; you respect boundaries and audits.
Collaborative and direct: crisp design docs, clear async communication, strong code reviews.
Comfortable with ambiguity and changing requirements; CET-friendly working hours.
Minimum Qualifications
Senior-level impact in production systems (typically 3–5+ years); Staff-track experience welcome.
1+ years of experience at a venture backed startup.
Strong Python with async fundamentals (asyncio), type safety, and packaging.
Event-driven backends and background jobs (queues, scheduling, retries) and resilient data sync between systems.
Postgres expertise: schema design, migrations, indexing, transactional integrity.
Integrations/ETL: import/export pipelines with validation, auditability, and safe rollback.
Infrastructure: GCP/GKE, Kubernetes/Helm, and Terraform (IaC) to design and operate cloud services.
CI/CD: ability to write GitHub Actions (or similar) workflows, add test/eval gates, and manage environment promotion.
Observability: traces/logs/metrics you actually use; define and hold SLOs; on-call ownership.
Security fundamentals: authN/authZ, multi-tenant separation, key/secret management.
Nice to Have
React/TypeScript front-end experience for operator/EHR surfaces.
FHIR R4 and/or Medplum; prior work with healthcare data models.
Data migration from legacy EHRs/schedulers; field mapping and reconciliation strategies.
OpenTelemetry, Metabase, Arize/Phoenix for model/ops monitoring.
Exposure to LATAM privacy/regulatory contexts (e.g., LFPDPPP, NOM-024/NOM-004).
Experience building operator/admin tools and lightweight internal platforms.
